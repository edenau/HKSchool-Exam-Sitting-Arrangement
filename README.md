# Hong Kong School Internal Examination Seating Arrangement System

## Project
I did this in high school. I believe I did not to a great job in terms of documentation so sorry about that.

## Background
High school students studying in Hong Kong local schools are required to take part in 4 compulsory subjects, 1-3 elective subjects and an optional extended part of Mathematics module 1 or 2 (M1 or M2) under New Senior Secondary (NSS) curriculum. There is a huge variety of subject combinations for each student. In my high school, according to the administrative section in the school, there were about 600 students in Form 4 to Form 6. They all took different combinations of elective courses. Apart from the compulsory subjects, there were 11 elective subjects, and M1, M2 available for students to take.

According to the interview with the manager of examination in my school, all students are required to complete the papers in the hall together so that it is easy to monitor studentsâ€™ behavior. Therefore, seat allocation in hall centre is required. Furthermore, a general examination time table and specific slips of admission form for each candidate are distributed by the assistant of examination. The form should include information such as:
- Student name
- Class and class number
- Papers taken by
- Date and time of each paper arranged in chronological order
- Location of examination for each paper
