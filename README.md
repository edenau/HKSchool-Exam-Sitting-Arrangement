# Hong Kong School Internal Examination Seating Arrangement System

## Statement
I did this in high school. I believe I did not to a great job in terms of documentation so sorry about that. Also sorry for me bad English as I wrote this years ago.

## Objectives
### Background
High school students studying in Hong Kong local schools are required to take part in 4 compulsory subjects, 1-3 elective subjects and an optional extended part of Mathematics module 1 or 2 (M1 or M2) under the New Senior Secondary (NSS) curriculum. There was a huge variety of subject combinations for them. There were about 600 students in Form 4 to Form 6 in my high school, and they all took different combinations of elective courses. Apart from the compulsory subjects, there were 11 elective subjects, and M1, M2 available for students to take.

All students were required to complete the papers in the hall at the same time, and therefore *(i)* seat allocation in hall centre was required. *(ii)* A general examination timetable and *(iii)* specific slips of admission form for each candidate were also necessary. The form should include information such as:
- Student name
- Class and class number
- Papers taken
- Date and time of each paper arranged in chronological order
- Location of examination for each paper

The specific slip of admission form should look like this:

<table>
  <tr><th colspan="5">Eden's High School 2012-2013 Final Examination</th></tr>
  <tr><th colspan="5">AU, Eden 5E (1)</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Date</td><td>Time</td><td>Paper</td><td>Venue</td><td>Seat No.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>10 June (Mon)</td><td>08:30-10:00</td><td>English 1</td><td>Hall</td><td>278</td></tr>
  <tr><td>10 June (Mon)</td><td>10:30-12:30</td><td>English 2</td><td>Hall</td><td>278</td></tr>
  <tr><td>11 June (Tue)</td><td>08:30-10:45</td><td>Mathematics</td><td>Hall</td><td>341</td></tr>
  <tr><td>13 June (Thur)</td><td>08:30-09:45</td><td>Chinese 1</td><td>Hall</td><td>271</td></tr>
  <tr><td>13 June (Thur)</td><td>10:45-12:15</td><td>Chinese 2</td><td>Hall</td><td>271</td></tr>
  <tr><td>14 June (Fri)</td><td>08:30-10:30</td><td>Liberal Studies</td><td>Hall</td><td>266</td></tr>
  <tr><td>18 June (Tue)</td><td>08:30-10:30</td><td>Chemistry</td><td>Hall</td><td>273</td></tr>

### System Requirements and Benefits
The Examination Seating Arrangement System (ESAS) aims to provide a convenient way to lay out pre-exam preparation such as time table arrangement, seat allocation etc.. The program has the following requirements:
- Clear interface for users â€“ manager and assistant of examination. Clear instructions should be displayed to guide them.
- Data of students can be imported for executing different tasks.
- Subject crash comparison (students doing the same combinations of courses) can be calculated and the best solution of time table arrangement with the least crash can be found.
- Seat numbers should be allocated in order of class and class number for management convenience.
- General time table and specific slips of admission form for all students can be
generated automatically referring to the data imported before and the time table arranged, which retrenches human power.

It can potentially bring the benefits, for instance
- Reduce time and workload for calculating subject crash comparison
- Avoid human errors
- Perform tasks effectively and analyze data automatically using imported data
- Allocate seats for students in good order
