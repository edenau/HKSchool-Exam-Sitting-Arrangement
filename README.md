# Hong Kong School Internal Examination Seating Arrangement System

## Project
I did this in high school. I believe I did not to a great job in terms of documentation so sorry about that.

## Background
High school students studying in Hong Kong local schools are required to take part in 4 compulsory subjects, 1-3 elective subjects and an optional extended part of Mathematics module 1 or 2 (M1 or M2) under the New Senior Secondary (NSS) curriculum. There was a huge variety of subject combinations for them. There were about 600 students in Form 4 to Form 6 in my high school, and they all took different combinations of elective courses. Apart from the compulsory subjects, there were 11 elective subjects, and M1, M2 available for students to take.

All students were required to complete the papers in the hall at the same time, and therefore seat allocation in hall centre was required. A general examination timetable and specific slips of admission form for each candidate were also necessary. The form should include information such as:
- Student name
- Class and class number
- Papers taken
- Date and time of each paper arranged in chronological order
- Location of examination for each paper

The specific slip of admission form should look like this:

<table>
  <tr><td colspan="5">Eden's High School 2013-2014 Final Examination</td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan="5">Eden 6E (1)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Date</td><td>Time</td><td>Paper</td><td>Venue</td><td>Seat No.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>10 June (Mon)</td><td>08:30-10:00</td><td>English 1</td><td>Hall</td><td>278</td></tr>
</table>
